for the two words that should be split, I can take them each individually into the old program that calculates the numbers and then move each word to the correct number entry 

also, double check, many may already exist

——
how to handle good phrases like:
advertising driven
vertically scrolling 
corporate owned

should I make a separate array of known compound phrases? 
I think it could make the piece better


in these cases


———
is the artist statement 
a space? 
a place of poetry and sound? 
a terrain?

maybe you ping pong between phrases
(or should it be user driven)? 
Or video poem 
(it could be all
maybe it could be a nice sonic space
where different word lengths or 
some kind of mapping is involved
maybe it uses the same word to number values
——


one way of thinking about the piece, is to make 
a series of number combinations 
some from lower to upper

experiment with 
three from higher with one lower

three lows and one high
experiment with ranges

——
for the space of art language
maybe it is skinned with searches for the words? 
or images of the art? 
it is like you are navigating the landscape of 2020
it is like you are navigating the 
cognitive space 
of digital media artists


would it be ridiculous to create it like vector space? 
or 
in other words
how should we organize the space? 
by numericaly related words or predefined phrases we know are compellng
maybe it is a combo
